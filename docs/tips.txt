1.
shellcheck  doesn't officially support bash (but it works).
the zunit tests file however, make it report  a bogus syntax errors
[{
	"resource": "/Users/adebert/h/minidocs/tests/unit/file_selection_unit_test.zunit",
	"owner": "bash",
	"severity": 8,
	"message": "`}'",
	"source": "bash",
	"startLineNumber": 23,
	"startColumn": 1,
	"endLineNumber": 23,
	"endColumn": 2
}]
you can ignore those

you can ignore linting too, we'll do it once code works


2. zunit's verbosity is passed to minidocs, hence:

zunit run --verbose -> will run both in verbose modes
